  Hi! I'm Chamodi Nimsara Rathnasiri, a passionate and creative individual from Kuliyapitiya, Sri Lanka. I’m someone who finds joy in expressing myself through words, music, and travel. Writing has always been one of my favorite ways to communicate my thoughts and feelings, while singing allows me to connect with others on a more emotional level. Exploring new places and cultures through travel has taught me to appreciate the diversity and beauty of the world. These experiences have shaped who I am and inspired my personal and creative journey.

  Academically, I’ve always had a strong interest in mathematics. I enjoy the challenges it brings and the satisfaction of solving complex problems. Alongside my academic pursuits, I also love watching movies and listening to music—they help me relax, spark new ideas, and fuel my imagination. Music, in particular, plays a big role in my life as both a listener and a performer. Looking ahead, my dream is to become a successful bank manager. I am committed to working hard, continuously learning, and developing the skills needed to thrive in the banking industry. I believe that with determination and passion, I can turn this dream into reality and make a meaningful contribution to my community.
